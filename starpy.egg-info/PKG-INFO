Description: StarPy Asterisk Protocols for Twisted
        =====================================
        
        StarPy is a Python + Twisted protocol that provides access to the Asterisk
        PBX's Manager Interface (AMI) and Fast Asterisk Gateway Interface (FastAGI).
        Together these allow you write both command-and-control interfaces (used, for
        example to generate new calls) and to customise user interactions from the
        dialplan. You can readily write applications that use the AMI and FastAGI
        protocol together with any of the already available Twisted protocols.
        
        StarPy is primarily intended to allow Twisted developers to add Asterisk
        connectivity to their Twisted applications. It isn't really targeted at the
        normal AGI-writing populace, as it requires understanding Twisted's
        asynchronous programming model. That said, if you do know Twisted, it can
        readily be used to write stand-alone FastAGIs.
        
        StarPy is Open Source and we are interested in contributions, bug reports and
        feedback.
